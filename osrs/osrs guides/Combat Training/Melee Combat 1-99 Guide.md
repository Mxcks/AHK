## Training Order

### Recommended Skill Order:
1. **Attack** → 60-70 (for better weapons)
2. **Strength** → 99 (for higher damage)
3. **Attack** → 99 (for better accuracy)
4. **Defence** → 99 (last, or train alongside)

### Why This Order?
- **Attack** unlocks better weapons (Dragon scimitar at 60, Abyssal whip at 70)
- **Strength** increases your max hit (more damage = faster kills)
- **Defence** can be trained last or passively with Slayer

### Alternative: Balanced Training
- Keep all three skills within 5-10 levels of each other
- More balanced progression
- Good for players who enjoy variety
