# Your First 10,000 Coins - Brand New Player Guide

## 🎯 Goal: Get 10,000 Coins in 30 Minutes

**Starting Point:** Just finished Tutorial Island
**Requirements:** LITERALLY NOTHING!
**Time:** 10-60 minutes depending on method
**Difficulty:** ⭐ Very Easy

---

## What You Have Right Now

### After Tutorial Island, You Have:
- Bronze sword
- Bronze axe
- Bronze pickaxe
- Wooden shield
- Some basic armor (maybe)
- **25 coins**
- Level 3 in most combat stats

**That's it! And that's enough!**

---

## Why You Need 10,000 Coins

### What You Can Buy:
- Full Black Armor set (~7,000 gp)
- Quest items for early quests (~6,000 gp)
- Basic supplies and food
- Teleport runes
- Training supplies

**10,000 coins is your first major goal!**

---

## Which Method Should You Choose?

### Quick Comparison:

| Method | Time | Coins | Difficulty | Risk |
|--------|------|-------|------------|------|
| **Stronghold** | 10-20 min | 6,250-11,250 | Medium | Might die |
| **Kill Cows** | 30-60 min | 10,000+ | Very Easy | None |
| **Chickens** | 20-30 min | 5,000 | Very Easy | None |

### Choose Stronghold If:
- ✅ You want money FAST (10 minutes!)
- ✅ You're okay with possibly dying
- ✅ You can follow directions to run past monsters
- ✅ You have 10-20 food (or can get it)

### Choose Cows If:
- ✅ You want 100% safety
- ✅ You want to train combat too
- ✅ You have 30-60 minutes
- ✅ You prefer low-risk methods

### My Recommendation:
**Try Stronghold first!** Even if you only get Floors 1-2, that's 6,250 coins in 10 minutes. If you die, you keep the coins and can try cows after!

---

## Method 1: Stronghold of Security (FASTEST - 10 Minutes)

### ⚠️ IMPORTANT: You DON'T Fight Anything!

**The Strategy:**
- You literally just RUN past all the monsters
- Don't attack anything
- Don't stop moving
- Just run to the rewards
- **You don't need good gear or levels!**

### Rewards:
✅ **11,250 coins total!** (not 10,000 - even better!)
✅ **Fancy/Fighting boots** (free cosmetic)
✅ **2,000 XP in any combat stat**

### Requirements:
- None!
- Can do immediately after Tutorial Island
- Just need to be able to run (everyone can!)

---

### Preparation (5 Minutes) - Get Some Food

**You don't NEED food, but it helps if you get hit!**

**Free Food Method (Recommended):**
1. Go to Lumbridge Swamp (south of Lumbridge)
2. Find a fishing spot (look for bubbles in water)
3. Right-click fishing spot → "Net" (catch shrimp)
4. Catch 10-20 shrimp (takes 2 minutes)
5. Go back to Lumbridge
6. Use shrimp on a range/fire (in Lumbridge castle kitchen)
7. Cook all shrimp
8. **You now have 10-20 food!**

**Alternative - Buy Food:**
- Go to Lumbridge General Store
- Buy 10 bread (12 gp each = 120 gp total)
- You start with 25 coins, so you can only buy 2 bread
- **Not recommended - you don't have enough money!**

**Alternative - Skip Food Entirely:**
- Just run fast and don't get hit much
- You might die on Floor 3 or 4
- That's okay! You respawn in Lumbridge
- You keep the coins you already collected!
- Just go back and finish

---

### Step-by-Step Walkthrough:
